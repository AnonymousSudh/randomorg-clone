# Welcome to my Random.org Clone!

### Introduction

This is a clone of Random.org that I am making for practice with React. I chose Random.org because I use it all the time to shuffle my Spotify playlist (their built in shuffle is terrible). I've noticed it's not as ✨ pretty ✨ as it could be and there's a few additions I'd like to make to make it's use a tiny bit faster. I will add a checklist of everything I'd like to do eventually because I am open to others contributing to this project. 

### If you'd like to help out:
1. Go ahead and [fork](https://github.com/SWELLZ/randomorg-clone/fork) the repo and create your own branch
1. Click the code dropdown and clone your fork however you prefer.
    - ```git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/meme-generator```
    - ```gh repo clone https://github.com/Dharmik48/meme-generator```
    - Or you can do this using GitHub Desktop
1. After cloning, head into your fork using your terminal 
    > ```cd randomorg-clone```
1. Then just run ```npm install``` or ```yarn install``` to download node_modules
1. finally, start a local dev environment using ```npm start``` and make your changes!

### Live Site
Since I now have a tiny bit of functionality, I have posted the site online [here](https://randomorg-clone.netlify.app/). No links in the navbar work and neither does the search bar. Currently, you can only shuffle a list of items and it will be displayed in an ordered list under the text area

Since this site uses React, it is super fast and the shuffled list generates much quicker than the real Random org site. It is also more responsive, if you go to the real site and scale the site you'll see a ton of overflow. And it will be a single page application since SEO isn't a concern.

This site is hosted on Netlify since I don't expect a lot of traffic

## Thanks!
