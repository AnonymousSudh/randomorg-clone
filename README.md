# Welcome to my Random.org Clone!

### Introduction

This is a clone of Random.org that I am making for practice with React. I chose Random.org because I use it all the time to shuffle my Spotify playlist (their built in shuffle is terrible). I've noticed it's not as ✨ pretty ✨ as it could be and there's a few additions I'd like to make to make it's use a tiny bit faster. I will add a checklist of everything I'd like to do eventually because I am open to others contributing to this project. 

### If you'd like to help out:
1. Go ahead and [fork](https://github.com/SWELLZ/randomorg-clone/fork) the repo and create your own branch
1. Click the code dropdown and clone your fork however you prefer.
    - ```git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/meme-generator```
    - ```gh repo clone https://github.com/Dharmik48/meme-generator```
    - Or you can do this using GitHub Desktop
1. After cloning, head into your fork using your terminal 
    > ```cd randomorg-clone```
1. Then just run ```npm install``` or ```yarn install``` to download node_modules
1. finally, start a local dev environment using ```npm start``` and make your changes!

## Thanks!
